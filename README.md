Artificial Intelligence (AI) is dramatically transforming the pharmaceutical industry, reshaping drug discovery and development at every stage. AI's ability to analyze vast datasets and detect patterns beyond human capability is speeding up the identification of potential drug candidates, thus reducing the traditionally lengthy and costly drug development process (Paul D. et al., 2020).

AI has significantly enhanced drug discovery by rapidly identifying hit and lead compounds (Mak K. et al., 2019). Advanced algorithms, including machine learning (ML) models such as deep neural networks (DNNs), predict the biological activity of compounds, refining drug screening and improving target validation. This is particularly important in an industry where nine out of ten therapeutic molecules fail in clinical trials, especially during the more expensive later stages (Beneke F. et al., 2019; Kalyane D. et al., 2020).

AI also plays a key role in drug repurposing, which involves finding new therapeutic uses for existing drugs. AI's predictive capabilities are useful in identifying synergistic drug combinations that may be more effective for complex diseases like cancer (Öztürk H, 2018). In drug development, AI tools like QSAR models predict the physicochemical properties of drug molecules, essential for evaluating a drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (Karimi M., 2019).

In pharmaceutical manufacturing, AI improves efficiency and precision. Automation tools such as the Chemputer platform are transforming molecule synthesis and production by reducing creation time and ensuring consistency, which enhances the safety and quality of pharmaceutical products (Rantaneej & Khinast, 2015; Chan H.S, 2019).

Predicting drug-target binding affinity (DTBA) is crucial for drug efficacy. AI-based methods measure this affinity by analyzing the drug's and target's chemical features or by comparing their similarities, based on the assumption that similar drugs interact with similar targets (Paul D. et al., 2021).

Despite its benefits, AI adoption in pharmaceuticals faces challenges. Implementing AI requires access to large, high-quality datasets, which are costly and difficult to obtain. There is also a need for skilled personnel to operate these advanced platforms and interpret the generated data. Nonetheless, the potential benefits of AI are driving significant investment, with projections suggesting substantial revenue growth in the sector (Lambert M.J, 2019; Research & Markets., 2019).

The future of AI in pharmaceuticals looks promising, with advancements expected to lead to more personalized and effective treatments. As AI continues to evolve, its role in drug discovery and development will become increasingly central, transforming disease understanding and treatment (Paul D. et al., 2021).
